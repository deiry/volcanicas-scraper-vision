    "# Volcánicas Scraper & Vision \n",
    "\n",
    "This repository contains scripts to support **Volcánicas**, a Latin American feminist journalism project, by automating content extraction from key sources and exploring AI-assisted video transcription.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "- Scrapes articles from Volcanicas links to extract structured information: title, URL, and detailed content.\n",
    "- Designed to enhance research and editorial workflows with feminist tech principles: autonomy, transparency, and ethical storytelling.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Web Scraping\n",
    "\n",
    "Three different approaches were explored to extract content from URLs:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. BeautifulSoup + Function Calling\n",
    "This method is fast and produces good results for static HTML pages. However, it struggles with dynamic websites, such as those using .aspx pages, which limits its applicability to the types of documents we are dealing with. To address output structure, json_schema was used to provide a structured response format. Despite its speed, this method is not suitable for JavaScript-heavy or dynamic pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Browser Use (Agent + Computer Vision)\n",
    "This approach leverages an AI-driven agent using GPT-4.1-mini and computer vision to scrape content. It iterates through leeloo-links.json, retrieves each URL, and sends it to the agent. The agent returns structured output in the Document format, including the title, URL, and full content. Results are saved in two formats: Markdown and JSON. Additionally, this method was tested to extract YouTube video descriptions (particularly for videos without audio). The best outcomes were stored in results/video_browser_use_results.json. This method was the most accurate and reliable overall.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. ChatGPT Operator\n",
    "This method was less reliable. While it occasionally returned results in Markdown format, it could not generate downloadable files. Furthermore, it was unable to interpret or extract content from YouTube videos.s\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conclusion\n",
    "The most effective approach is Browser Use with AI agents, especially for dynamic and media-rich content. To update the results, simply modify leeloo_links.json and run the second notebook option. The full process takes approximately 30 minutes and consumes around 21,555 tokens aournd $0.00618\n",

      "  \"date\": \"May 13, 2025\",\n",
      "  \"content\": \"Esta es una breve descripción del espectáculo de seguridad tramado y aprovechado en Ecuador por el presidente Daniel Noboa para la implantación de un régimen no democrático a través de las últimas elecciones en el país.\\n\\nEl 9 de enero de 2024, en su primer periodo, Noboa declaró un conflicto armado interno tras un evento sucedido ese mismo día: el secuestro online del canal TC Televisión por parte de un presunto grupo criminal. Menos de dos horas después, el decreto 111 entraba en vigencia. El país no recibió jamás un informe sobre aquellos adolescentes que ingresaron armados al canal y se quedaron parados allí sin saber qué hacer, sin leer un comunicado, sin llevarse a nadie. Si bien el personal del canal vivió terror, no se sabe quién lo infligió. Ese mismo día, en Guayaquil, once personas murieron por balas perdidas. Nunca se supo más, se sembró olvido.\\n\\nEl 10 de enero, con millones de personas confinadas por temor a nuevos eventos, la Asamblea Nacional aprobó la ley de competitividad energética, de carácter privatizador, que se ofrecía como solución al racionamiento de electricidad que sufríamos, con cortes de hasta 24 horas seguidas.\\n\\nEl 11 de enero, la Corte Constitucional aprobó un acuerdo entre Estados Unidos y Ecuador en materia militar. Así, entre el 9 y el 11 de enero, la declaración de conflicto armado, la aprobación de la ley energética y el dictamen de la Corte Constitucional sucedieron en estado de excepción, con toque de queda y modalidad virtual de la vida. La doctrina de shock, mostrada al desnudo, provocó extenuación social, angustia, pánico colectivo y, por tanto, ansia de seguridad.\\n\\nEn las semanas que siguieron al decreto 111, se pretendió forzar la costumbre del culto a los militares como se hace en algunos lugares de Estados Unidos, donde nació Daniel Noboa. El presidente quería que fueran aplaudidos al vérselos en el supermercado, que su heroicidad fuera celebrada por la población civil. Hubo restaurantes que les ofrecían comidas gratis en sus cuentas de Instagram, la gente organizó donaciones fervientes de comida, la empresa privada gestionó otras a mayor escala.\\n\\nEl culto militar, la glamurización de la estética G.I. Joe y el chaleco antibalas como banalizado accesorio de moda –la primera dama los lleva en beige– se usaron para naturalizar el modelo militar de gobierno y fabricar el espectáculo de seguridad, todo ello financiado por el mismísimo pueblo.\\n\\nEn las prisiones, se estableció enseguida un gobierno militar de tortura y tratos humillantes. Los comités de familias de personas en prisión dieron la voz antes que nadie. Se habían organizado de forma más decidida desde 2021, a raíz de las crecientes masacres carcelarias en el país, que hoy cuentan más de seiscientas personas asesinadas o abandonadas a la muerte lenta de la desnutrición, la tuberculosis o heridas no tratadas.\\n\\nLos comités buscaron sin cesar interlocución con las instancias responsables. Un grupo de madres, hermanas y esposas de personas privadas de libertad llegó a la Asamblea Nacional. Tuve el privilegio de acompañarlas en la comisión legislativa de derechos humanos: las vi exponer imágenes de hombres desollados con bolsas de plástico calientes; jóvenes con huesos rotos, sostenidos con cordones de zapato; personas desnutridas como en un campo de concentración; charcos de sangre seca. Ellas también alertaron sobre la hambruna provocada en las prisiones y la prohibición de que familiares y abogadxs ingresaran en visita. El estado de derecho, visto desde allí, había desaparecido.\\n\\nEn las calles, los palos de madera con que los militares golpeaban a sus víctimas tenían escrito “derechos humanos” con marcador negro, en burla. Se dieron las primeras ejecuciones extrajudiciales y desapariciones forzadas en ese marco. Carlos Javier Vega tenía 19 años. Durante un operativo, fue ejecutado por un militar a plena luz del día. Él y su primo fueron catalogados por las Fuerzas Armadas como «presuntos terroristas» a quienes detuvieron «ante un intento de ataque a un retén militar». Su error fue cometer una infracción de tránsito.\\n\\nAl cumplirse cien días del decreto 111, en abril, docentes de universidades de todo el país se sumaron en una protesta contra la militarización. Ante la crítica que venía de ese sector, Noboa dijo: «Hay un pocotón de PhD que nos atacan, más suenan como HPs (hijos de puta)». El manifiesto «150 docentes contra la militarización» reclamaba por el perfilamiento racial contra jóvenes negros, afrodescendientes o migrantes vistos como delincuentes que serían falsos positivos; la tortura psicológica contra las familias de personas privadas de libertad, incomunicadas desde enero con sus familiares; el traspaso de poder a los militares, que producía abusos propios de regímenes dictatoriales, como suspensión de garantías y tortura; gastos millonarios de guerra que corrían por cuenta de la población, mientras las oligarquías lucraban de territorios abandonados por la violencia; el ingreso de contingentes militares y policiales a comunidades de megaextracción minera. Nada de esto cesó.\\n\\nSe sumaron otras expresiones de golpismo de Daniel Noboa durante la segunda parte del año y de cara a la campaña electoral. No solicitó la debida licencia para hacer campaña ni delegó su cargo a Verónica Abad, vicepresidenta. Noboa llegó a trabajar como presidente de lunes a jueves y a salir de campaña «el finde». Fueron eternas las discusiones entre el Consejo Nacional Electoral (CNE), el Tribunal Contencioso Electoral (TCE), la Asamblea Nacional y el candidato-presidente, quien desacató la norma con la complicidad y sumisión de la presidenta del CNE. Esto le permitió a Noboa el libre uso de fondos del Estado para proselitismo: bonos, obra «chueca» o incompleta entregada en campaña, visitas a hospitales que se hacían con personal vestido con el color de su empresa-partido, ADN.\\n\\nEn noviembre, Verónica Abad acusó a Noboa de preparar un golpe de Estado, pues no respetaría la delegación de funciones presidenciales que le correspondería a ella cuando él solicitara la debida licencia. Abad fue perseguida por Noboa con un sumario administrativo del Ministerio de Trabajo, por lo cual fue suspendida de su cargo. Mientras la Asamblea Nacional la ha certificado como vicepresidenta de la república, Noboa sostiene que fue destituida, atropellando la Constitución.\\n\\nUn invitado especial al banquete paramilitar en la etapa final de campaña fue el estadounidense Erik Prince, fundador de la compañía de seguridad antes llamada Blackwater. Prince es mercenario, su equipo fue acusado de asesinatos en Irak. De hecho, en 2020, Donald Trump indultó a cuatro guardias de esa empresa que cumplían sentencias por asesinar a catorce civiles, entre ellos dos niños, en una masacre que desató la protesta internacional por el uso de mercenarios en la guerra. Supuestamente, Prince llegaba a Ecuador a dar asesoría y capacitación. Se exhibió en medios y dio opiniones políticas, desacreditando a Luisa González, la contendora de Noboa, con comentarios misóginos y advirtiéndonos que, de ganar ella, seríamos «Venezuela», ese gran comodín de las derechas. Prince no cumplió con asesoría ni capacitación, pero sí paseó por Guayaquil arrestando a gente luego liberada por no tener cargos, vestido, junto con otros hombres duros, como G.I. Joe. El espectáculo militar-paramilitar funciona, vende humo de seguridad donde no hay nada y el pánico social lo compra.\\n\\nSiendo un billonario latinoamericano nacido en Miami, el poder de Noboa es considerable. Tanto, que ha sido capaz de enjuiciar cuarenta y dos veces a su primera esposa, secuestrar a la hija que tienen en común al violar el régimen de visitas y usar a la niña para campaña exhibiendo su rostro, lo cual está prohibido. Ecuador es el mayor exportador mundial de banano, y esa industria la ha acaparado la familia Noboa. Daniel suma al modelo militarizado de gobierno un capital de generaciones que ha explotado a miles de trabajadorxs y la tierra.\\n\\nSu tía, Isabel Noboa, tiene acciones en megamineras que los militares «protegen» de las comunidades en resistencia. Su esposa, la influencer Lavinia Valbonesi, mandó talar un bosque protector en Olón para meter allí un proyecto inmobiliario, pero no lo consiguió, gracias a la protesta social. Su hermano Santiago está envuelto en el caso Petronoboa, donde podría haber tráfico de influencias y comercialización ilegal de combustible. Su madre, Anabella Azín, fue elegida diputada y podría presidir la Asamblea Nacional. Es un reino.\\n\\nHoy, el Centro de Derechos Humanos de Guayaquil denuncia que hay por lo menos cuarenta y dos víctimas de desaparición forzada en Ecuador y «manifiesta preocupación por el incremento de casos principalmente en Esmeraldas, Guayas y los Ríos», provincias muy marcadas por la violencia. Cientos de jóvenes han sido perfilados por los militares. Una escena emblemática de ello fue la de un joven con un tatuaje en el pecho al que obligaron a borrárselo con un cepillo metálico, desollándose, porque parecía tatuaje de banda. Hechos similares se repitieron decenas de veces, a plena luz del día, con los militares como dueños de las calles, por meses, aterrorizando.\\n\\nEn la primera vuelta electoral, Noboa no despuntó como hubiera esperado. De forma sorpresiva aún para él, en la segunda tuvo un millón doscientos mil votos más que Luisa González. ¿Los tuvo? El CNE, sumiso a Noboa como se dijo antes, le acaba de negar el recuento de votos a González.\\n\\nDaniel Noboa despertó el 9 de enero de 2024 sabiendo que ese día iniciaría su campaña: declarar a Ecuador bajo ataque y un conflicto armado interno; promover el culto militar cada día, sin escatimar fondos; contratar mercenarios internacionales; darles poder a los militares, que no admiten otra autoridad que la propia, entregarles las cárceles y las calles, y preparar con ello, lentamente, su fraude: avanzar, mes a mes, con acciones de seguridad, su espectáculo mayor, para ser, en 2025, el salvador de esta guerra. Pero en febrero de 2025 hubo 736 muertes violentas, según cifras del Estado.\\n\\nA los cortes de electricidad Noboa los llamó sabotaje. Al derrame petrolero más grande en la historia de Ecuador lo llamó sabotaje. A la violencia social la llama terrorismo. Siempre bajo ataque, él será siempre un salvador. Este espectáculo llega a tal punto que el supuesto plan de erradicación del crimen organizado se llama Plan Fénix, ave que Noboa se tatuó como parte de su timo en diciembre de 2024. En lugar de buscar vías de desactivación de la violencia, uno de sus hashtags preferidos fue #EcuadorBajoAtaque. El pánico como brida.\\n\\nSemanas antes del tatuaje, habían desaparecido en manos militares los Cuatro de Las Malvinas, Steven, Saúl, Ismael y Josué. Estos niños afroecuatorianos, de un barrio muy castigado, fueron vistos por última vez tras un partido de fútbol, cuando fueron detenidos por Fuerzas Armadas. Días después, sus cuerpos fueron hallados cerca de una base militar. Estaban calcinados. El dolor de sus familias y de todo el país dejó indiferente a Noboa, que mandó un mensaje muy claro: nunca se pronunció, no declaró un duelo nacional ni dijo una palabra de solidaridad. Las pruebas forenses revelaron agujeros de bala en el cráneo de cada uno de los niños, probablemente disparadas desde arriba.\\n\\nLos falsos positivos, el culto militar, la presencia paramilitar y el golpismo le aseguraron a Noboa un segundo periodo, en lugar de destronarlo. Si se habla de fraude, que cada vez se muestra más probable, éste empezó hace mucho, a base de golpes que se han llamado blandos o dados en varios tiempos. El plan de estos quince meses consistió en controlar, perfilar, y asegurar así poderes que permitan acaparar tierras, promover explotación megaminera y privatizar. Poder político, acumulación acelerada, desmantelamiento del Estado. No hay planes para salud, educación ni vivienda. Sí hay planes para un nuevo proceso constituyente, cuyo objetivo es despojar de derechos a la población, muchos de ellos consagrados en la Constitución de 2008.\\n\\nNayib Bukele y Donald J. Trump son los hermanos mayores del pequeño gran gobernador del reino. Del primero aprendió el cruel espectáculo de la prisión exhibida como jaula para mostrar su poder. Al segundo le compró unos minutos de fama y una foto por varios millones de dólares en una cena privada en Estados Unidos. Entre prisiones de tortura, ajustes permanentes, flexibilización de las relaciones de trabajo y extenuación por consecuencia del despojo acelerado en varias regiones del país, la fragmentación social es cada vez más palpable. La derecha y el golpismo aparecen ahora como funcionales a estas condiciones y aprovechan la desilusión política y la desesperanza que vivimos.\\n\\nDesde la Confederación de Nacionalidades Indígenas del Ecuador (CONAIE), Leonidas Iza, dirigente panzaleo y ex candidato presidencial, denunció el 24 de abril en el Foro Mundial de los Pueblos Indígenas de Naciones Unidas que el gobierno está implementando seis proyectos megamineros en territorios de pueblos y nacionalidades de Ecuador. «Los pueblos no somos sacrificables», dijo Iza. Y, sin embargo, vemos zonas de sacrificio cada vez mayores.\\n\\nEl 9 de mayo, once militares fueron asesinados durante un operativo contra la minería ilegal de oro en el Alto Punino, zona selvática fronteriza con Perú. En esto día se habla de una emboscada preparada por altos mandos militares que lucran de la ese tipo de minería, lo que exhibe la opacidad de las relaciones entre Estado, grupos criminales y mineros. La militarización, que ahora cobra vidas en el propio ejército, no se detiene, por el contrario, se exacerba a fin de sostener la narrativa securitista del gobierno. En el Alto Punino, a pocas horas de Quito, la devastación de la selva coexiste con la pobreza extrema y la desvaloración de la vida, de toda forma de vida.\"\n",
